# Rain Forecasting and Prediction ML Project

This project is a Python-based machine learning solution for forecasting and predicting rain. It uses popular libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. 

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure
- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `main.py` - Entry point for your ML workflow
- `data/` - Place your datasets here
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration

## Usage
- Add your data to the `data/` folder.
- Run `main.py` to train and evaluate your model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Customization
Modify `main.py` or add notebooks to experiment with different models and features.
